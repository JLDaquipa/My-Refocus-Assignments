- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Jay Lloyd and I'm just your ordinary and friendly fellow human :D
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Web Development, Cinematography & Coffee.
- ðŸŒ± My goal for the year is to learn more about React & Node.js.
- ðŸ˜Ž I want to become a web developer because it's where I find myself confident in doing and a profession where I find it fun which makes it for me worth it to do for a living.
